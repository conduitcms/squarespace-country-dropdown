# squarespace-country-dropdown
A list of countries that you can copy and paste into the drop down category of squarespace's form function.

----

To find a NON-WORD-WRAPED list of countries you can copy and past, navigate to the "countries" file of this commit.

Feel free to submit additional countries and changes.

I started this file with United States and Canada as this works best for most localized North American forms.

I recommend putting the country you do business with the most at the top of yours and moving the USA and Canda countries down if this is placed somewhere else.

Consider committing other languages as well (chinese, japanese, russian, etc).
